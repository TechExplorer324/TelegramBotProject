need to update list of companies in check_file.txt cause I used 1 year old excel Sheet

bot.py and config.py are main, used to communicate between my telegram bot and chatgpt

company checker.py is there to ensure that the #word is actually a company listed on stock market with help of check_file.txt

filtered_words.txt there only contains company names listed on stock market (with some error, because my excel sheet is old and does not match 100% with the ICICI messages cause Laursen and Turbo is written in different formats in both

hashtag.py extracts the #words from the messages sent and puts it in words_list.txt

output.txt just lists the text messages into bullet points using the code paragraph_seperaotr.py
